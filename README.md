# project-manager
This bash script provides convenient access to my projects and their corresponding Neovim saved sessions. 

> It offers a **quick** and efficient way to navigate and open specific projects, along with their associated Neovim sessions, streamlining my development workflow.

## Reason
The main reason for creating this repository is to maintain a record of my learning journey with bash scripting. 
My goal is to develop a project manager using the latest techniques I have acquired, showcasing my progress and skills in this area.
